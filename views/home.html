            <h2>GitHub Documentation</h2>
            <p>Of course it's to be expected that the documentation of a project designed to provide documentation will be good :)</p>
            <p>You can find our documentation here.</p>

            <h2>Azure SDK for Node</h2>
            <p>This library inspired me to write this application.  It has awful documentation (although it is steadily improving)</p>
            <p>However, the source code is very well documented, so if you browse it on here it looks great.</p>

        <a href="/visionmedia/express" style="text-decoration: none; color:black;">
            <h2>Express</h2>
            <p>If you're using node.js you really should be using express.  It has simply the best framework for building web-servers.  I love how unopinionated the design is, anything that causes debate becomes a separate module, so you can choose.</p>
            <p>As with all of visionmedia's projects, it has excelent documentation.</p>

        <a href="/visionmedia/dox" style="text-decoration: none; color:black;">
            <h2>Dox</h2>
            <p>This is one of the libraries that this application is built off.  It's responsible for parsing source code into a JSON structure that can be rendered as documentation.</p>
            <p>Of course, being all about documentation, it works great if you browse it on GitHub Docs.</p>

        <a href="/visionmedia/dox" style="text-decoration: none; color:black;">
            <h2>QEJS</h2>
            <p>This is another library that this application is built off.  It's responsible for combining the output of parsers like dox and a special template file to produce a web page.</p>
            <p>It has a beautifully simple API for dealing with asyncronous operations within a template, which is why we use it here.</p>
